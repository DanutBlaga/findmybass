 - When first accessing the website, people will see a table containing

   and place of manufacturing, current location, a brief description of
   the instrument, as well as images
 - There will be a simple rating system, comprised of a simple "thumbs
   up" and "thumbs down" system, or "like" and "dislike"

   have Fender basses, and someone uploads information regarding their
   personal MusicMan instrument), then a new entry will be created and
   displayed on the main page
 - A user can only upload an instrument if they have a logged account on
   the site, and the same goes for upvotes and downvotes
